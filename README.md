# Game of Life

Java implementation of the Game of Life programming exercise.

## Overview/Task

To build a programme that exhibits the game of life, 
an ever evolving two-dimensional grid, 
that evolves over time based on a set of rules. 

The rules are as follows:

   * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
   * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
   * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
   * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
